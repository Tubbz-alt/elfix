This is POC to demonstrate the inheritance of MPROTECT PaX flag when
a binary loads a library, either via normal dynamic linking or via dlopen.
The binary/library are variously marked -M (enabled) or -m (disabled) MPROTECT.

The library contains an RWX mmapping which is forbidden.  The binary just
calls the library.

What you need:

	0. Preferrably do this on the One True Distro, hardened gentoo.
	1. Run a pax enabled kernel with PAX_MPROTECT
	2. Install sys-apps/paxctl

How to use this 

	0. ./autogen.sh to build the build system
	1. ./configure to configure the build
	2. make
	3. sudo make install
	4. sudo make check

Enjoy the results which should be self explanatory.
