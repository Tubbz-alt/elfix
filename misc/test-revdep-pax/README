This POC is based on paxmark-libs and is used to test revdep-pax.

Because revdep-pax only works on packages already installed on the
system, we can't build in a test triggered by USE="test" unless we first
RDEPEND on this package.  But this would mean putting a garbate package
just for a test and we don't want to polute people's systems.

So here's how you test revdep-pax with this package.

EITHER prepare the package yourself:

	1. ./autogen.sh 
	2. ./configure 
	3. make dist
	4. cp testrevdeppax-0.1.tar.gz /usr/portage/distfiles/
	5. cp testrevdeppax-0.1.ebuild /some/overlay/location
	6. repoman manifest


OR use my overlay

	1. layman -a blueness
	2. echo "source /var/lib/layman/make.conf" >> /etc/make.conf


THEN

	1. ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64" emerge testrevdeppax
	2. testrevdeppax.sh

The script tests all possible combinations of the RANDMMAP flag on both
the binary /usr/bin/testrevdeppax and library /usr/lib64/libmyrevdeppax.so.0.0.0
It then tests both forward migrating the pax markings from the binary to the
library and then reverse migrating them from the library to the binary.
