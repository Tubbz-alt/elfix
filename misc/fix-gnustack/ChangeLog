	* Seperate out fix-gnustack.  See: https://bugs.gentoo.org/518524

2014-06-07

	* Switch from error() to errx() make the code portable to musl (and BSD).

2013-05-20

	* Add check if ELF_C_RDWR_MMAP is declared in libelf.h.  This distinguishes
	elfutils from libelf.  The former will not build on uclibc, but the later
	does not provide ELF_C_RDWR_MMAP.

2012-07-29

	* remove unnecessary check for yasm in configure.ac
	* make tests/gnustack machine independant by generating
	native assembly using gcc

2012-07-27

	* switch from yasm to gcc for assembler for arches other than
	x86 and amd64
	* opening an ELF_C_RDWR does not work for either libelf or
	elfutils, so revert to ELF_C_RDWR_MMAP.  This does, however,
	break linking against libelf

2012-07-24

	* switch from ELF_C_RDWR_MMAP to ELF_C_RDWR to link again libelf
	for uclibc systems

2011-11-26

	* fix-gnustack and paxctl-ng: fix exit code on success

2011-04-14

	* Initial release of fix-gnustack
